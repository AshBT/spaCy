I left academia in June 2014, just when I should have been submitting my first
grant proposal.  I left because I don't like the grant system.  It's not the
best way to create value, and it's not the best way to get paid.

I've been writing spaCy for six months now, and I'm very excited to release it.
I think it's the most valuable thing I could have built.  It opens up a lot of
possibilities.  It's really right up-to-the-minute with the best systems being
published, while also being ready for production use.

To make spaCy as valuable as possible, I've decided against
a repeating-revenue, SaaS-type business model.  I doubt game developers license
3d engines on a monthly basis, and I think spaCy is in a similar category.  To
make use of it, you need to invest significant resources.  Development is
expensive.  The investment is risky enough without having to worry that the
engine you're using might not be available in a year's time.

Simply, there are products and features

Examples
--------

The following user-stories were written to describe to my counsel how the
license is intended to work.  If your counsel believes that they do not
accurately describe the license terms as they are written, that is an
**implementation bug** --- please report it!


Ashley and Casey: Seed stage start-up
#####################################

Ashley and Casey have an idea for a start-up.  To explore their idea, they want
to build a minimum viable product they can put in front of potential users and
investors.

They have two options.

  1. **Trial commercial license.** If they enter their email and tick a box, they
    can use spaCy for six months for $0.  They are free to modify spaCy, and they
    will own the copyright to their modifications for the duration of the license.
    After the trial period elapses, they can either pay the license fee, or release
    their contributions under the GPL, with copyright transferred to me as per
    the contributor agreement.

  2. **GPL.**  Casey and Pat can instead use spaCy under the GPL license.
     However, they must then release any code that statically or dynamically
     links to spaCy under the GPL as well (e.g. if they import the module, or
     import a module that imports it, etc).  If they make any direct modifications
     to spaCy, these must also be released, and copyright must be released to
     Honnibal NLP, following the contributor license agreement.
     
Ashley and Casey find the GPL license unattractive for commercial use --- as
they are supposed to.  They decide to take up the trial commercial license.
However,  over the next six months, Ashley has to move house twice, and Casey gets
sick.  By the time the trial expires, they still don't have a demo they can show
investors.  They send an email explaining the situation, and a six month
extension to their trial license is granted.

By the time the extension period has elapsed, spaCy has helped them secure
funding, and they even have a little revenue.  They are glad to pay the $5,000
commercial license fee.

spaCy is now permanently licensed for the product Ashley and Casey are
developing.  They own the copyright to any modifications they make to spaCy,
but not to the original spaCy code.

No additional fees will be due when they hire new developers, and if they are
acquired, the license will be transferred to the company acquiring them.  However,
to use spaCy in another product, they will have to buy a second license.


Alex and Sasha: University Academics
####################################

Alex and Sasha are post-doctoral researchers working for a university.  Part of
their funding comes from a grant from Google, but Google will not own any part
of the work that they produce.  Their mission is just to write papers.

Alex and Sasha find spaCy convenient, so they use it in their system under the
GPL.  This means that their system must also be released under the GPL, but they're
cool with that --- they were going to release their code anyway, as it's the only
way to ensure their experiments are properly repeatable.

Alex and Sasha find and fix a few bugs in spaCy.  They must release these
modifications, and their patches are accepted into spaCy.  However, Alex and
Sasha do not retain the copyright to their patches: under the contributor
license agreement, copyright is transferred to Honnibal NLP.  When Honnibal NLP
goes on to sell commercial licenses to spaCy, no royalties are due to Alex and
Sasha.

Later, Alex and Sasha implement new features into spaCy, for another paper. 
Their implementation uses a lot of memory, and I do not accept their patches into
the main branch of the project.  However, they can still distribute a fork of the
project with their changes --- although they are only able to grant GPL licenses to
their fork, as they do not retain the copyright.

Honnibal NLP agrees to **never prevent contributors from distributing their
modifications under the GPL.** So, Alex and Sasha know that they'll never be
prevented from helping other researchers repeat their experiments.


Phuong and Jessie: Open Source developers
#########################################

Phuong and Jessie use Calibre to manage their e-book libraries.  They have an
idea for a search feature, and they want to use spaCy to implement it.  Calibre
is released under the GPL, so Phuong and Jessie can use spaCy to improve
Calibre.  They'll have to release their code, but that was always their
intention anyway.
